An event's impacts.unitOps moves the war on the map. Each op is one of:
{"op":"spawn","unit":{"name":"","type":"infantry|armor|air|naval|artillery|garrison","ownerCode":"","strength":100,"lng":0,"lat":0,"regionId":""}}

{"op":"strength","unitId":"<existing id>","strength":0,"note":""}
{"op":"remove","unitId":"<existing id>","note":""}
Spawn and relocate units to reflect mobilizations, offensives and reinforcements. Honor the player's queued move/attack orders unless implausible, and contest them with enemy unitOps. Only reference unit ids that appear in "Current military units". When a front is decisively won, also emit a matching regionTransfers entry so the border moves with the troops.

Generate 3-8 meaningful events, not filler. Never invent player actions the player did not order. Make the final event notable if it deserves immediate attention.`,
