title Open Historia - Updater

REM ============================================================
REM  Open Historia - one-click updater
REM  ----------------------------------------------------------
REM  Replaces this install's files with the latest ones from
REM  GitHub, without touching your saved games or settings.
REM
REM   - Git installs (folder has .git):  git pull + LFS
REM   - ZIP installs:                    downloads the latest
REM     code and copies it over this folder
REM
REM  What is protected:
REM   * server\data\games        (your save games)
REM   * server\data\*.json       (your library state)
REM   * existing scenario files  (new ones are added, yours
REM                               are never overwritten)
REM   * public\assets\*.pmtiles  (real map data is never
REM                               replaced by LFS pointer stubs)
REM
REM  After updating, run "Launch Open Historia.bat" as usual -
REM  it reinstalls dependencies and rebuilds automatically.
REM ============================================================

REM Which repository to update from. The beta channel lives on the beta
REM branch of the organisation repository - updating keeps tracking it.
set "REPO_OWNER=Open-Historia"
set "REPO_NAME=open-historia"
set "REPO_BRANCH=beta"

REM ---- Self-update safety --------------------------------------------------
REM cmd reads batch files incrementally, so the update replacing THIS script
REM on disk mid-run would corrupt the running interpreter. Re-run from a temp
REM copy instead: the copy performs the update and can safely overwrite the
REM original updater along with everything else. (The .sh updater is already
REM safe - bash parses it fully into main() before any of it executes.)
if /I not "%~1"=="/from-temp" (
    copy /Y "%~f0" "%TEMP%\open-historia-updater.bat" >nul
    "%TEMP%\open-historia-updater.bat" /from-temp "%~dp0"
    exit /b
)

REM Work from the folder the ORIGINAL script lives in (the project root)

echo Updating files ^(saves and map data are preserved^)...

REM Big map files ship as tiny LFS pointer stubs inside GitHub ZIPs. They must
REM never overwrite (or trigger deletion of) the real local data. Robocopy
REM never purges excluded files/dirs, so these are safe under /MIR too.
set "KEEP_FILES=*.pmtiles regions-seed.geojson cities-seed.json"

REM 1) Repo-owned code directories are MIRRORED: new files added, changed files
REM    updated, and files the update removed are deleted locally too.
for %%D in (src scripts public) do (
    if exist "%SRC%\%%D" (
        robocopy "%SRC%\%%D" "%CD%\%%D" /MIR /NFL /NDL /NJH /NJS /NP /XF %KEEP_FILES% >nul
        if errorlevel 8 goto :copyfail
    )
)

REM    server code is mirrored as well, but server\data (saves, scenarios,
REM    library state) is fully protected from both copying and deletion.
if exist "%SRC%\server" (
    robocopy "%SRC%\server" "%CD%\server" /MIR /NFL /NDL /NJH /NJS /NP ^
        /XD "%SRC%\server\data" "%CD%\server\data" /XF %KEEP_FILES% >nul
    if errorlevel 8 goto :copyfail
)

REM 2) Root-level files (package.json, launcher, README, configs...) are
REM    copied without purging - the root also holds node_modules, dist etc.
robocopy "%SRC%" "%CD%" /LEV:1 /NFL /NDL /NJH /NJS /NP /XF %KEEP_FILES% >nul
if errorlevel 8 goto :copyfail

REM 3) Scenario content: ADD new files only - never overwrite the player's
REM    existing scenario data (robocopy /XC /XN /XO copies only new files).
if exist "%SRC%\server\data\scenarios" (
    robocopy "%SRC%\server\data\scenarios" "%CD%\server\data\scenarios" /E /XC /XN /XO /NFL /NDL /NJH /NJS /NP >nul
    if errorlevel 8 goto :copyfail
)

REM Force a rebuild on next launch so the update actually takes effect.
