## 🍴 About this fork

This is a personal fork ([`rsb1813/open-paxhistoria`](https://github.com/rsb1813/open-paxhistoria)) of
[`Open-Historia/open-historia`](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia), developed independently
(not upstreamed). Changes on top of upstream:

- **Anthropic custom endpoint** — point the Anthropic provider at a self-hosted proxy that speaks the
  Messages API format (Settings → Anthropic → Endpoint), routed through the server relay for CORS safety.
- **Per-provider custom parameters** — a JSON field per AI provider merged into outgoing request bodies,
  for things like reasoning budget/effort limits the built-in UI doesn't expose.
- **Globe country-label fix** — country name labels no longer render oversized at high latitudes in 3D
  Globe mode; each label is now corrected for its own latitude, not the camera's.
- **Settings icon + country badge** — settings toggle is now "⋮", and the player's country shows as a
  small flag badge (bottom-right) instead of a text pill (custom/non-ISO polities fall back to a letter badge).
- **Community hub cover images + detail view** — scenario cards show a cover image when the hub post has
  one, and clicking a card opens a detail view with stats and an "Import & Play" button.
- **Map interaction & display settings** — a new Settings section with toggles for hiding country labels,
  disabling idle globe rotation, reversing scroll-zoom direction, and disabling pan inertia, plus sliders
  for zoom sensitivity, border width, and feature (label) size.
- **Sensitive flag blur** — an opt-in setting that blurs flags for a small list of commonly-disputed
  polities wherever a flag renders.
- **Installable as a PWA** — the app can be installed as a standalone app. Works out of the box from
  `localhost`; installing from other devices on the LAN needs a self-signed HTTPS cert (see
  [Installing the app (PWA) on other devices](#installing-the-app-pwa-on-other-devices)).
- **Accounts, server-side settings, and encrypted AI keys** — the first person to open the app creates
  the owner account (email + password); after that, new accounts are invite-only (added from Settings
  once signed in — there's no public sign-up). Map/display settings, AI provider choice, and API keys
  now live on the server per account (API keys encrypted at rest) instead of only in one browser, so
  they follow you across devices. Existing browser-only settings/keys are offered for one-time import
  on first login. `node scripts/reset-password.mjs <email> <newPassword>` resets a password from the
  command line if you're ever locked out.

This fork is meant for personal/self-hosted use (yourself, family, friends on your own server) — it
isn't set up or intended for public deployment.

## 🚀 Installation

### Easiest

- **Windows:** double-click **`Launch Open Historia.bat`**
- **macOS:** double-click **`Launch Open Historia.command`** (first run: right-click → *Open*)
- **Linux:** run `./"Launch Open Historia.sh"` in a terminal

The launcher checks Node.js, downloads the map data, installs dependencies, builds,
and opens the game. To update an existing install later, run the matching
**`Update Open Historia`** script for your platform — it fetches the latest version
while preserving your saves, scenarios, and map data.

#### Android app (thin APK)

Easiest: download **`pax-historia.apk`** from the
[**Android release**](https://github.com/Open-Historia/open-historia/releases/tag/android)
and open it to install (allow installs from your browser when Android asks).
On first launch the app finds the Termux server on the same phone by itself;
to play against another machine, type its address once — it's remembered.
It's a thin client: the game itself runs on the server it connects to.

for it to work, you should have termux on your device setup

<details>
<summary>Build the APK yourself (needs the Android SDK)</summary>

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx cap sync android
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug   # gradlew.bat on Windows
```

The APK lands in `mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. (Or open
`mobile/android` in Android Studio and press Run.) Maintainers: the
**Build Android APK** action in the Actions tab builds and republishes the
release APK — run it after changing `mobile/`.

</details>

### Manual

Prerequisites: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsb1813/open-paxhistoria.git
cd open-paxhistoria
git lfs install        # Set up Git LFS
git lfs pull           # Pull large files (map tiles + editor seeds + world map)
npm install            # Install dependencies (includes OpenLayers etc. for the editor)
npm run build          # Build the client
node server/server.js  # Start the server
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. The first visit asks you to create the owner
account (email + password) — after that, sign in with it every time.

> **Note:** the large map assets (`*.pmtiles`, `public/assets/*-seed.*`, and
> `server/data/scenarios/default/regions.geojson`) live in Git LFS. If you downloaded a
> ZIP instead of cloning, run the launcher script for your platform — it fetches them automatically.

#### Installing the app (PWA) on other devices

The app can be installed as a standalone app (manifest + service worker). Installing from
`http://localhost:3000` on the machine running the server works out of the box. Installing from
another device on the same network — `http://192.168.x.x:3000` — does not, because a plain LAN
address isn't a secure context and service workers refuse to register on it. To fix that:

```bash
node scripts/generate-dev-cert.mjs   # writes certs/dev-cert.pem + certs/dev-key.pem
node server/server.js                # now serves https://<your-LAN-IP>:3000
```

> **Once the cert exists, port 3000 is HTTPS-only** — there's no separate HTTP port anymore. This
> also affects the host machine itself: use `https://localhost:3000`, not `http://`, and the same
> for the `Launch Open Historia` scripts and the Android app's connect address (both default to
> `http://`). If you don't need LAN installs, don't run the generator and the port stays plain HTTP
> exactly as before. Delete `certs/` to go back to HTTP.

The cert is self-signed, so every other device must be told to trust it once — otherwise Chrome
refuses the connection outright. Copy `certs/dev-cert.pem` to the device and install it as a
trusted certificate (Android: Settings → Security → Install from storage → CA certificate; iOS:
AirDrop/email the file, open it, then enable full trust under Settings → General → About →
Certificate Trust Settings; Windows: double-click → Install Certificate → Local Machine → Trusted
Root Certification Authorities). Re-run the generator if your LAN IP changes.

## 🌍 Scenarios

**Modern Day** is the only built-in scenario. All other official presets — *WWII 1939*,
*Medieval 1200*, *Rome 117 AD*, *Mongol World 1300*, *New World 1650* — live on the
[**Scenario Hub**](https://github.com/Arkniem/pax-historia-scenarios), pinned at the top of
the in-game **Community** tab. Import any of them with one click, or publish your own.

To rebuild an official preset from source (specs live in `scripts/presets/`):

```bash
node scripts/presets/build-preset.mjs scripts/presets/wwii-1939.spec.mjs
```

To regenerate the built-in Modern Day map: `node scripts/build-default-map.mjs`

## 🗺️ Map editor

Open any scenario's editor and click **🗺️ Open Map Editor** (or visit
`http://localhost:3000/?editor=1` for the standalone editor). Draw regions, split and
merge borders freehand, paint owners, import 70k cities, sign your map, then
**Apply & Play**.
